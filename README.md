Secure Peer to Peer Decentralized Network Protocol 
The need for a standardized, secure, and decentralized communication or file transfer protocol is becoming urgent with the passing of each day. CISPA is officially declared 'dead' in the Senate, only to be reborn under a new title. Canada have recently upgraded their anti-terror legislation by stomping on civil liberties. Worldwide governments are illegally spying on their citizens. The media manipulate us into thinking we're all guilty and should live in fear. They tell us we don't deserve privacy for legal, ethical, simple communication between our friends, family and global users.
